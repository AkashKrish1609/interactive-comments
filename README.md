### What I learned

Uff!!..Amazing experience in completinng this project for many reasons...The things I learned in Javascript from doing this project were a lot..Some of it are....
- use of backtick in js..This was the first time I used it and I love it already..
- A lot of properties like nextElementSibling, nextSibling, target.closest(), preventDefault(), stopImmediatePropagation() and many more..
- I came to know about HTMLcollection and how to use Array.from() to change it into array and use filter() property to filter the array and get the required element with the class name
- I learnt about Focus() and stuff

To be honest 95-99% I used only the design as a reference that is why this project is so special for me.. I worked day in and out for a week seeking help from a lot and from stackOverflow ofcourse.... I have been patient and hard-working in this project and I could do this project even better.... Trust the Process...
